## General Principles

<Steps>
1. **Size Impacts Visibility**

    Size is arguably the most effective way to emphasize visual elements. Simply put, larger elements draw greater attention than smaller elements.  
2. **Perspective Creates an Illusion of Depth**

    We generally perceive larger objects as being closer than similar smaller objects and, therefore, they usually command attention before any other object on a page.
3. **Color and Contrast Draw Attention**

    Bright colors usually draw greater attention than duller hues. For example, if a single sentence in a block of text is highlighted with a bright color, it immediately grabs readers' attention.
4. **Fonts Organize Design**

    Typeface hierarchies can be created with text of various sizes, weights and spacing — or a combination of each element. Using a variety of type sizes, for example, not only emphasizes what's most important, but also organizes the overall design of the document.
5. **Space Provides Emphasis and Movement**

    When arranging the elements of a composition, designers can use the space around the content to draw attention to particular elements — think of a single element on a blank page — or to send an entirely separate visual message, such as the hidden “arrow” found within the famous FedEx logo. 
6. **Proximity Suggests Relationships**

    Placing related elements close together suggests to readers that they are, in fact, related.
7. **Negative Space Emphasizes**

    Including white space around elements singles them out as separate groups of information. Negative, empty space not only makes information easier for readers to digest by grouping it into compartments, but it also creates focus as it helps eyes zero in on individual items.
8. **Alignment Directs Eyes**

    Most Western readers are accustomed to reading from the left to the right sides of a page. Therefore, designs featuring text are often aligned to the left margin in the same fashion.

    Right alignments are often employed to provide balance to an overall design that may be more visually heavy on the left side. Likewise, left alignments can offer the same effect in the reverse scenario.
9. **Odd-Numbered Groups Create Focus**

    The **Rule of Odds** allows designers to emphasize particular images by placing them in the center of a group. By placing an equal number of neighboring objects on either side of the main focal point — thus creating an odd - numbered group — the result clearly points to the most important visual element, located in the center.
10. **Repetition Unifies a Composition**

    Just as contrast emphasizes and draws attention to design elements, repetition creates unity, which boosts understanding and recognition. 
11. **Lines Suggest Movement**

    Movement is one of the most effective ways to attract viewers' attention, especially when it's implied within a still design. Lines are obviously efficient in pointing to items of emphasis—just think about an arrow—but they don't have to physically appear on the page to do the trick.
12. **Grids Organize a Design**

    The **Rule of Thirds** involves mentally dividing a composition into a grid composed of two horizontal and two vertical lines—or nine separate sections. Important visual elements are placed along the lines, emphasizing the four points where the lines meet.

## Exercise: Mood Boards
Create a [mood board](https://www.google.com/search?q=mood+boards) that illustrates these concepts. Use these examples as inspiration on your learning journey. See [these examples](https://acidtone.github.io/code-journal/#july-16th-2022) from [Tony's Code Journal](https://acidtone.github.io/code-journal/#jan-29-2023).
<Steps>
1. Do an online search of a topic(s) of your choice and follow the top links that are returned.
2. Take screenshots of examples that show effective (or ineffective) use of one or more of the principles above.
3. Compile these examples as a post in your code journal. If you feel the need to present them in a layout, try building your mood board in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or a similar tool.
