Structured HTML content is the first step to adding visual hierarchy to web text. In this exercise, you will take text content copied from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and add semantic HTML markup to describe what the content is to the browser.

## Instructions
<Steps>
1. Pick a hobby or interest that you could build a webpage around;
2. Find open source content on Wikipedia that contains examples of:
    - Headings (`<h1>`-`<h6>`)
    - Paragraphs (`<p>`)
    - Links (`<a>`)
    - Bold (`<strong>`) and italicized (`<em>`) text
    - Bullet (`<ul>` and `<li>`) and/or numbered (`<ol>` and `<li>`)lists
3. Create an `index.html` file in your workspace.
    <Aside title="Pro-tip" type="tip">
    Type `!` and then the `Tab` key inside an empty `.html` file to create an empty page!

    Alternatively, you can use an online code sandbox such as [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) or [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/).

4. Copy the Wikipedia text from your browser window.
    <Aside type="caution">
    For the purposes of this exercise, _do not_ copy and paste HTML markup from your Inspector. You want to copy vanilla text content from your main browser window.

5. inside a `<main>` container inside the `<body>` element of your `.html` page;
6. Wrap the text in the appropriate html element (see Step 2).
    - `<h1>`-`<h6>` for headings
    - `<p>` for paragraphs
    - `<a>` for page links
    - `<strong>` and `<em>` for bold and italicized text
    - `<ul>`/`<ol>` and `<li>` for lists
</Steps>

When you are finished, your code should look similar to [this example](https://codepen.io/browsertherapy/pen/RwaJmbx). Use the code your created for the next exercise or use the above example as a starting point.
