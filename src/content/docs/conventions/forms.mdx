## Website Form Usability

1. Keep it short.
2. Visually group related labels and fields.
3. Present fields in a single column layout.
4. Use logical sequencing.
5. Avoid placeholder text, because (See: [Placeholders in Form Fields Are Harmful](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/)):
    - Disappearing placeholder text strains users' short-term memory.
    - Without labels, users cannot check their work before submitting a form.
    - When error messages occur, people don't know how to fix the problem.
    - Placeholder text that disappears when the cursor is placed in a form field is irritating for users navigating with the keyboard.
    - Fields with stuff in them are less noticeable.
    - Users may mistake a placeholder for data that was automatically filled in.
    - Occasionally users have to delete placeholder text manually.
6. Match fields to the type and size of the input.
7. Distinguish optional and required fields, because (See: [Marking Required Fields in Forms](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/required-fields/)):
    - People don't read instructions at the top of forms.
    - Even if people read instructions, they may forget them.
    - People have to scan the form to determine if the field is required.
8. Explain any input or formatting.requirements.
9. Avoid Reset and Clear buttons.
10. Provide highly visible and specific error messages.

## Checkboxes vs. Radio Buttons
Source: [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/checkboxes-vs-radio-buttons/)
1. **Radio buttons** are used when there is a list of two or more options that are **mutually exclusive** and the user must select exactly one choice.
2. **Checkboxes** are used when there are lists of options and the user may **select any number** of choices, including zero, one, or several.
3. **A stand-alone checkbox** is used for a single option that the user can turn on or off.
4. **Use standard visual representations**. A checkbox should be a small square that has a checkmark or an X when selected. A radio button should be a small circle that has a solid circle inside it when selected.
5. **Visually present groups of choices as groups**, and clearly separate them from other groups on the same page. 
6. Lay out your lists vertically, with one choice per line. 
7. **Use positive and active wording for checkbox labels**, so that it's clear what will happen if the user turns on the checkbox. 
8. **If possible, use radio buttons rather than drop-down menus**. 
9. **Always offer a default selection for radio button lists**.
10. **Because radio buttons require exactly one choice, make sure that the options are both comprehensive and clearly distinct**. 
11. Let users select an option by clicking on either the button/box itself or its label: a bigger target is faster to click according to Fitts's Law. In HTML forms, you can easily achieve this by coding each label with `<label>` elements, as I've done for the example with horizontal radio buttons above (to select that option, click on the word "Four").
12. **Use checkboxes and radio buttons only to change settings, not as action buttons** that make something happen.
