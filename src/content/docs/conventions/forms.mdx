1. Keep it short.
2. Visually group related labels and fields.
3. Present fields in a single column layout.
4. Use logical sequencing.
5. Avoid placeholder text, because (See: [Placeholders in Form Fields Are Harmful](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/)):
    - Disappearing placeholder text strains users' short-term memory.
    - Without labels, users cannot check their work before submitting a form.
    - When error messages occur, people don't know how to fix the problem.
    - Placeholder text that disappears when the cursor is placed in a form field is irritating for users navigating with the keyboard.
    - Fields with stuff in them are less noticeable.
    - Users may mistake a placeholder for data that was automatically filled in.
    - Occasionally users have to delete placeholder text manually.
6. Match fields to the type and size of the input.
7. Distinguish optional and required fields, because (See: [Marking Required Fields in Forms](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/required-fields/)):
    - People don't read instructions at the top of forms.
    - Even if people read instructions, they may forget them.
    - People have to scan the form to determine if the field is required.
8. Explain any input or formatting.requirements.
9. Avoid Reset and Clear buttons.
10. Provide highly visible and specific error messages.

## Checkboxes vs. Radio Buttons
1. **Radio buttons** are used when there is a list of two or more options that are **mutually exclusive** and the user must select exactly one choice.
2. **Checkboxes** are used when there are lists of options and the user may **select any number** of choices, including zero, one, or several.
3. **A stand-alone checkbox** is used for a single option that the user can turn on or off.
4.** Use standard visual representations**. A checkbox should be a small square that has a checkmark or an X when selected. A radio button should be a small circle that has a solid circle inside it when selected.
5. **Visually present groups of choices as groups**, and clearly separate them from other groups on the same page. The boxed example above violates this guideline because the layout makes the two checkboxes appear to be addressing separate topics when theyre actually alternative options for a single topic. 
    - **Use subheads to break up a long list of checkboxes** into logical groups. This makes the choices faster to scan and easier to understand. The risk is that users might view each subgroup as a separate set of options, but this is not necessarily fatal for checkboxes — each box is an independent choice anyway. A list of radio buttons, however, must always appear unified, so you cannot use subheads to break it up.
6. Lay out your lists vertically, with one choice per line. If you must use a horizontal layout with multiple options per line, make sure to space the buttons and labels so that it's abundantly clear which choice goes with which label. 
7. **Use positive and active wording for checkbox labels**, so that it's clear what will happen if the user turns on the checkbox. In other words, avoid negations such as "Don't send me more email," which would mean that the user would have to check the box in order for something not to happen. 
    - Write checkbox labels so that users know both what will happen if they check a particular box, and what will happen if they leave it unchecked.
    - If you can't do this, it might be better to use two radio buttons — one for having the feature on, and one for having it off — and write clear labels for each of the two cases.
8. **If possible, use radio buttons rather than drop-down menus**. Radio buttons have lower cognitive load because they make all options permanently visible so that users can easily compare them. Radio buttons are also easier to operate for users who have difficulty making precise mouse movements. (Limited space might sometimes force you to violate this guideline, but do try to keep choices visible whenever possible.)
9.** Always offer a default selection for radio button lists**. By definition, radio buttons always have exactly one option selected, and you therefore shouldn't display them without a default selection. (Checkboxes, in contrast, often default to having none of the options selected.) 
    - If users might need to refrain from making a selection, you should provide a radio button for this choice, such as one labeled "None." Offering users an explicit, neutral option to click is better than requiring the implicit act of not selecting from the list, especially because doing the latter violates the rule of always having exactly one option chosen.
10. **Because radio buttons require exactly one choice, make sure that the options are both comprehensive and clearly distinct**. In tests with older users, for example, people couldn't complete a form that required them to select their job because it didn't offer "retired" as an option. If it's impossible to be comprehensive, offer a button labeled "Other," supplemented by a type-in field.
11. Let users select an option by clicking on either the button/box itself or its label: a bigger target is faster to click according to Fitts's Law. In HTML forms, you can easily achieve this by coding each label with `<label>` elements, as I've done for the example with horizontal radio buttons above (to select that option, click on the word "Four").
12. **Use checkboxes and radio buttons only to change settings, not as action buttons** that make something happen. Also, the changed settings should not take effect until the user clicks the command button (labeled "OK" for example, or "Proceed to XXX" where "XXX" is the next step in a process). 
    - 
    If the user clicks the Back button, any changes made to checkboxes or radio buttons on the page should be discarded and the original settings reinstated. The same guideline obviously holds if the user clicks a Cancel button (though navigational web pages don't need a cancel option because the Back button serves the same purpose).
    - If the user first clicks Back and then Forward, then it's most appropriate to interpret this sequence as an Undo-Redo pair, meaning that the appearance of the controls should show the user's changes as if the user had never clicked Back. These changes should still not take effect on the backend until the user clicks "OK" or an equivalent command.
