## Terminology
**Responsive Web**: A Web development concept focusing on making sites look and behave optimally on all devices, from desktop to mobile, using the same served web files.

**Content Parity**: A measure of content consistency between mobile and desktop versions of the same website.

**Viewport**: The viewable area of a website within the browser window.

**Media Queries**: A feature of CSS that enables webpage content to adapt to different [screen sizes](https://codepen.io/browsertherapy/pen/mdPaZdW), [orientations](https://codepen.io/acidtone/pen/QWLZxRx), aspect ratios and mediums (e.g. print vs screen). It does this with conditional code blocks (i.e. `if` statements for CSS).

**Breakpoint**: Points in responsive design where website presentation obviously changes due to changing viewport characteristics (width, orientation, etc).

**Hamburger Menu**: A button in websites and apps that typically opens up into a vertical menu or navigation drawer.

**Card Pattern**: A convenient means of displaying content composed of different types of objects. They are also well-suited for presenting similar objects whose size or supported actions can vary considerably, like photos with captions of variable length

## Mobile Navigation: Image Grids or Text Lists?
- Text Menus Are More Efficient
- Images Can Help Users Differentiate
- Optimize for More Images per Scroll

Text Menus or Images? Know that they're each good at different levels in the site's information hierarchy: 
- For the **broadest** and most diverse category levels, a **text menu allows users to quickly navigate** to the content in which they are interested.
- Once the differences between options become more **nuanced**, a grid of **images helps users differentiate various offerings** and make a more informed selection.

## Mobile Subnavigation

- **Design Goals**:
    1. **Minimum interaction cost**: Users should be able to access an element of interest in the navigation with as little effort as possible. That means few taps, little scrolling, and zero page loads if possible.
    2. **Typical-path support**:  If, within a single session, users are likely to jump from a page in one section to another one in a completely different area of the site, subnavigation should make it easy.  If, on the contrary, most visitors will “live” in a single section of the site (say, the sports section of a newspaper), then the subnavigation should focus on supporting that pattern.
    3. **Discoverability**:  Users should be able to find the subnavigation UI quickly, with no chance of confusing it with the main navigation.
- **Types of Subnavigation on Mobile**:
    - Accordions Inside a Main Menu
    - Sequential Menus:  a menu which shows only the subcategories of the last selected category.
- **Section Menus**: separate menus (distinct from the main navigation menu) that appear on section homepages.
- **Category Landing Page**s: a landing page that serves as a navigation hub for all the pages within a given section.
